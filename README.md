# OLVQ_AEC
implementation of "Pattern Classifiers with Adaptive Distances" in IJCNN 2011.


## Getting Started

The `olvq_AEC` function classify input data based on Optimized Learning Vector Quantization with Adaptive Distances. These data sets can be found in the UCI machine site => http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html
These datasets are included in the project:
1. Iris
3. Glass
4. Heart
5. Pima
6. Wine
7. Image Segmentation
8. liver-disorders
9. Habermanâ€™s survival
10. Magic gamma telescope
11. Seed
12. Artificial Dataset1
13. Artificial Dataset2
14. Tae
15. Banana
16. Balance
17. Ecoli
18. Penbased


## Running the tests

simply run ```olvq_AEC``` and choose one of the above mentioned datasets.
